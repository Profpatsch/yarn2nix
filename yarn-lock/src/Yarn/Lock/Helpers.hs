Module : Yarn.Lock.Helpers
Description : Helpers for modifying Lockfiles
Maintainer : Profpatsch
Stability : experimental

Freshly parsed 'Lockfile's are often not directly usable
e.g. because they still can contain cycles. This module
provides helpers for modifying them.

-- | Takes a 'Lockfile' and removes dependency cycles.
--
-- Node packages often contain those and the yarn lockfile
-- does not yet eliminate them, which may lead to infinite
-- recursions.
--
-- Invariant: Every dependency entry in each package in the
-- 'Lockfile' *must* point to an existing key, otherwise
-- the function crashes.
